LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell r_ack_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) enableAck_reg/CLR, r_ack_reg/CLR, r_counter_reg[0]/CLR, r_counter_reg[10]/CLR, r_counter_reg[11]/CLR, r_counter_reg[1]/CLR, r_counter_reg[2]/CLR, r_counter_reg[3]/CLR, r_counter_reg[4]/CLR, r_counter_reg[5]/CLR, r_counter_reg[6]/CLR, r_counter_reg[7]/CLR, r_counter_reg[8]/CLR, r_counter_reg[9]/CLR, r_x_reg[0]/CLR (the first 15 of 38 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
